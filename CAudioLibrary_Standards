Our C Embedded Audio Library Standards

1. Wavetable and Non-wavetable versions of all functions
	- functionName_WTx: indicates the use of the wavetable version of functionName. x represents data resolution in number of bits (8,16,32,64)
	- functionName_Ex: indicates the use of a non-wavetable version of functionName, with varying levels of efficiency, from x = 0 (lowest efficiency) to however many we make...

	The goal is to allow the user to make their own tradeoffs between accuracy, efficiency, and code size, depending on their platform's limitations. 

2. Audio processing happens on a per-sample basis in a tick function which receives the most recent input sample if it needs input

3. 32-bit and 64-bit implementations 

4. All functions and "classes" should be well-commented and well-documented. The expect unit of nput parameters to functions should be specified. Example code should show proper use and some fun and handy use cases.
